<!-- ### "and such" -->
<!-- One of these days, I may do something similar to [matklad](https://matklad.github.io) where Ihave a narrative section in front of my resume. As it stands, there's not really much to narrate; I continue to shape my view of software every day, including what I find interesting, challenging, and worthwhile. All I really know is that I've fallen in love with `cargo`, and that should be quite self explanatory. -->

I guess I can't call this a brief detour from our regularly scheduled programming, since I have yet to establish what regularly scheduled programming looks like, but I wanted to have a blogpost that I update on occasion to store some of my favorite other blogs, and people who I know! This list will forever be incomplete.

### People I know:
1. [Ved Thiru](https://www.vedthiru.com)

### Blogs I Like:

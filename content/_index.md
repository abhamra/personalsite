## Hi, I'm Arjun!

<img src="https://github.com/abhamra/personalsite/blob/master/content/Images/headshot.jpg?raw=true" alt="Headshot of me!" width="190" align="right" />

I'm a 4th year CS major @ Georgia Tech concentrating in [Systems Architecture](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/academics/threads/systems-architecture) and [Theory](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/academics/threads/theory). I'm currently learning about quantum computing, compilers, and PL theory!

### Research
My research interests center around compilation and programming languages, especially as they relate to quantum computing. Broadly, I want to design software that is easy to use and lifts as much weight off the shoulders of developers. My prior research has been in enabling this via Qwerty, a domain-specific language for writing quantum programs. More recently, I have been exploring concepts in program synthesis and search-based compiler techniques for DSLs. Always something new to learn!

I work @ the [Center for Novel Computing Heirarchies (CRNCH)](https://crnch.gatech.edu/) in the TINKER Lab with Dr. Tom Conte and PhD student Austin Adams on quantum programming languages and compilers!

<!-- Our paper, **[ASDF: A Compiler for Qwerty, a Basis-Oriented Quantum Programming Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13262)**, has been accepted to CGO 2025, and our paper on the Qwerty language itself is set to appear at QCE25, in the QSYS track! -->

### Work
I've spent most of my (limited) work life in the space of quantum compilers; in the summer of 2023, I worked @ [Quantinuum](https://www.quantinuum.com/), where I designed a domain specific language for Repeat-Until-Success circuits. The following summer, I worked @ [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/quantum) on rewriting their hardware Quantum Assembly compiler in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/rust). This past summer (2025), I returned to IBM to work on quantum algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems.

I also co-chair [dependently-typed](https://dtyped.netlify.app/), the compilers and programming languages club @ GT. As a part of the club, I have given talks on MLIR, [compiler optimizations for data locality](compiler_opt_for_data_locality.pdf), and [program synthesis](program_synthesis.pdf).

A more complete resume can be found [here](resume.pdf).

### What do I do?
I read somewhere recently that when asked about what someone does, the first answer is some sort of work related answer, and any hobby or passion is designated second-place. Perhaps that's because of how the question was phrased, but it's an interesting thought. Anywho, here are some things I find curious, interesting, fun, and the like :]
- Drumming
- Music, particularly Jazz and Funk, although I'll listen to basically anything that isn't country
    - [A favorite playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6Cb0nIeiLKU5iLzKOTE2V1?si=7de1db6e6d134ff3)
- Anime and animated shows (FMAB, TLOVM, A:TLA, Arcane, and Blue Eye Samurai are some standouts!)
- FPS Games (currently playing Marvel Rivals and Battlefield 1/5)
- DND (we try not to minmax quite hard, here)
- Creative Writing (*work in progress*)
- My [dotfiles](https://github.com/abhamra/dotfiles) setup

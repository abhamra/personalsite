Day 3’s problem was particularly interesting to me, and I did some silly (and hopefully somewhat clever) stuff that I think would be fun to write about.\nHere we are.\nI likely won’t redescribe the puzzles in full - for that, just head over to Advent of Code - but I will summarize the parts briefly.\nPart 1: This is where the fun begins\nSo the main goal of this problem is to, within a single line/string, find matches of mul(num1, num2) and sum up all of the multiplication operations, giving you your answer. The sample text they provide for this is:\n\nwhich will eventually output (2*4 + 5*5 + 11*8 + 8*5) = 161\nInitially, I thought I could do it with Regex, and you certainly could, but that didn’t feel like a satisfying enough solution to me. One of my friends also challenged me to use just Rust’s standard library and nothing else, so that removed the regex crate from contention entirely. My next idea, which is what I ended up going with, was to basically handwrite a lexer and do some nifty sliding window magic.\nStep 1: Defining Tokens\nFirst thing’s first, we have to define the tokens we’re going to be using. With a little bit of inspiration from the fantastic Crafting Interpreters, I ended up with the following:\n\n(To be clear, Crafting Interpreters also helped elsewhere)\nClearly, the only tokens that make up something like mul(num1, num2) are mul, (, ,, ), and numbers. Anything else is captured as OTHER and thrown away (handled, admittedly, in quite a disgraceful way. I wonder what my future employers would think).\nStep 2: Lexing the damn thing\nWarning: there’s gonna be a shitload of code below. I will explain it in a moment\nFirst, we set up the file reading and the iterator over our characters:\n\nWe call peekable() on our iterator because the Peekable struct provides us the peek method, which allows us to look at the next character without consuming it. This is particularly advantageous when we want to look ahead just once or twice in a controlled manner.\nNow, here’s where the magic happens!\n\nThis is a lot, so I’ll break it down for the relevant chunks. We’ve also removed the part 2 code from here as well (and it will return soon). Naturally, we start by iterating until there are no more characters to yield. In each match arm, we handle a specific character case.\nThe parentheses and the comma are pretty self-explanatory - just add the corresponding token variant to the vector - but the number and mul keyword handling are slightly more involved.\n\nThis seems like a bit of word vomit, but is nicer with a few choice words explaining it, I hope. It’s also largely lifted from this post by Bruno Calza, so thank you Bruno. Here, we essentially chain together iter::once(ch) (i.e., a single repetition of the first/matched character, to make sure it’s included in the resulting String), followed by all of the following characters that are digits, using Peekable’s next_if function, which takes in a function that returns a boolean and allows us to continue based on a condition. I won’t go into much more depth, but this is an interesting construction that I did not entirely come up with.\nFinally, there’s the mul keyword match. The idea is simple, if we see an m, let’s check the two following characters and see if they are u and l! I don’t think this is a safe assumption to make all the time, but this design choice was selected in order to optimize developer implementation efficiency (it was 2 AM).\n\nThe Rust standard library has a next_chunk function in nightly, and when I was originally implementing this, I used many a iter.peek(), is_some(), next_if_eq(), and other nested gems. However, after Ved correctly pointed out that nothing was stopping me from writing my own wannabe replacement, I got to work. It’s quite simple (with a more complicated extension), and I’ll talk about them more towards the end.\nStep 3: Whatever shall we do with this token stream?? (parse it [kinda])\nThe last major piece of the puzzle is as follows; now that we have our very cool token stream, how the hell do we make it useful? The fun way I thought of doing this was by using a sliding window over the tokens; since we know the structure of the mul operation quite well, we can just pass a window of the necessary size and check if it contains the necessary elements! For each slice, if there’s a match, we add the product of the values contained within, otherwise just add 0.\n\nThis was quite fun to solve, and for all its flaws and overengineering, it was an enjoyable experience.\nPart 2: To Multiply or Not to Multiply\n(it’s a toss-up, who knows)\n(we know, see below)\nThe second problem centers around do() and don't() within a code fragment:\n\nWhen a don't() is encountered, until a do() is encountered after, all multiplications in between are invalidated. In order to support this, we make 3 major additions:\n\nAdd DO and DONT as variants to the Token enum\nAdd lexing support for DO and DONT\nFind out a way to remove the correct muls from consideration before using our sliding window technique\n\n(1) is trivial, so let’s look at (2) just a bit closer.\n\nWe add this to the match statement from before, and it follows the same principle as mul. If we see a d, then we check if we have an o. After that, we branch based on whether or not the next value is n or not, and Bob’s your uncle or something. Before we explain next_chunk (finally), let’s look at (3), which was also cool.\n\nI hadn’t really used retain before, but it’s conceptually quite simple; we pass in a function on an iterator, and it will retain all elements that return true.\nThe way this relates to our construction is as follows: if we hit a DONT, we want to begin deleting, and we also want to delete DONT so we return false. If we hit DO, we want to set delete to false, but we want to clear away the DO as well. For any other elements, keep them if not in delete mode. This action allows us to maintain the invariant of not having DO or DONT at sliding window matching time (see part 1 step 3).\nI found this quite elegant, and the whole thing works as well.\nnext_chunk :D\nNow it’s finally time to showcase my darling boy; next_chunk:\n\nPretty self-explanatory, but the real kicker is when we try to use const generics and return something with type [I::Item; N]:\n\nThis bad boy right here is a bit crazier, although after digesting it, it becomes much more manageable.\n\nWe use const generic const N: usize for our sizing, and return an array\nBecause we can’t initialize an empty array, we use std::mem::MaybeUninit\nWe populate said array\nWe can now “safely” convert the array of MaybeUninits to an array of I::Items instead, with std::mem::transmute (see this article for a great discussion on transmute)\nWe can rest easy knowing we can now call the function like\n\n\ninstead of\n\n(nice work buddy, the array comparison is more space efficient than the vector equivalence check, at least :D)\nThat’s all, folks!\nI hope you guys enjoyed my first real blog and this assault on the English language.

Whatever shall we do to verify their validity???\n(Tragic, I know.)\nHistrionics aside, the basis of this problem is simple; we have lines that give us a before|after relation between pages, and then we have lines of pages as a list, and we have to verify that they work. A sample input is as follows:\n\nOur end goal for part 1 is to sum up the middle pages of all of the “correctly ordered” lines, but I will mostly be focusing on how we can check for that, rather than the overall solution.\nTo begin, I create a rule_map that contains, for every before page, a HashSet of all of the pages that must come after it! For example, in the above input, notice that 13 must come after 29, so that gets placed in our rule_map. This is populated as follows:\n\nWe add an entry for after to make it easier to handle cases later.\nThen, the real checking begins when we encounter the lines, and the logic here is that since we have a mapping (for a given page number) of all of the pages that should come after it, if we have seen a page that should come after our current page, we know we’ve found an incorrect list.\n\nA small nifty thing here is the continue 'outer syntax; if we are in a for loop that is nested, but we want to break out of the outer for loop, we can tag the outer for loop with 'outer: for ... in ..., and then use the continue 'outer syntax! This also works with break as well.\nAfter this, if we haven’t found an error, then we just add the middle page values up with sum += nums[nums.len()/2] (simple as).\nPart 2: Topo-sort is inevitable\nThere are 100% other ways to do part 2.\nHowever.\nI could not find them.\nIt was 2 AM again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnywho.\nSo the basis of this problem is that for all of the incorrect rows we marked previously, we now want to fix them and find the sum of their middle pages, a la part 1. Originally I was thinking of some sort of bubble sort esque swapping solution, but I couldn’t intuit it nicely, so I went with topological sorting instead since it felt somewhat natural.\nAs a brief aside, it felt natural primarily because we’ve been dealing with what is essentially a dependency graph this entire time, and it’d be a shame not to leverage that structure with a nicely made DAG just sitting there, yknow?\nSo the rest of this section is going to basically just be an introduction to topological sorting because you can probably fill in the gaps as to how the rest of part 2 is done.\nTopological Sorting, for dummies\n \nSimply put, given a directed acyclic graph (DAG), a topological sort is a linear ordering of vertices such that for all edges from u to v, u is “before” v in the linear ordering.\nA good example is in this image which is for this original list [97,13,75,29,47] (thank you to Ved for the graph).\nThere are a few ways to implement toposort, but the most intuitive to me is Kahn’s Algorithm, which goes as follows:\n\n(Prior to doing much of anything) For the list you are trying to sort, calculate the “in degree” of each vertex; this is just the number of nodes that have edges flowing into the current node.\n\n\nNote that we have to be careful to do our in degree calculation locally, and not over the whole list, since the whole list may not have a valid topological sort (may not be an acyclic graph).\n\nNow that we have our in degree calculated for all relevant nodes, we can create a queue of zero in degree nodes. Intuitively, we want to start at the nodes that have no other nodes as dependencies. This can be done easily with:\n\n\n\nDo the actual topological sort. This is arguably best explained with the code itself, so take a look below and I’ll explain in bits and pieces after:\n\n\n\nFirst, we take a node from the zero in degree queue and add it to the sorted list.\nThen, for all of the neighbors of the popped node, decrement their in degree. You can think of this as deleting a node that feeds into the neighbors, so decrementing is natural.\nIf the new in degree of any of the neighbors is 0, they get added to the zero in degree queue, and we repeat until done!\n\nLife’s sorted again\nAnd there you have it, done with day 5! This was a pretty fun problem to solve, and I’m somewhat happy with how my solution turned out. See you next time :D\n","description":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/aoc24day5/","path":"/blog/aoc24day5/","title":"Advent of Code Day 5: Topological Sort!"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/are-photos-real/":{"body":"Word Count: 1427\nI’ve been wondering about this for a fair few months now, ever since I heard it mentioned in a Vergecast episode, or perhaps a video before that on computational photography, or perhaps even before that, when I was writing that joyous exposé into my thoughts on memory. Because that’s what it is for, isn’t it? We take photos largely to remember. Of course, there are those that take photos for art, to edit and beautify to evoke a nice mixture of emotions like Remy’s visualization of taste from Ratatouille, but even that style of photography bears its roots in the idea of remembrance, of giving someone a long-lasting feeling of a place they saw, or never saw but felt like they did because of you and your photo.\ngranularity.\nA photograph (colloquially referred to by everyone as a photo) has a few definitions, depending on the granularity; here is where the journey of the impostor photo begins. I’ll begin by stating some examples from reputable dictionaries, and will try to order them by pedantry or some other silly metric. Also, I feel it prudent to mention that this all sounds like the beginning of a cheesy wedding vow (“Merriam-Webster’s dictionary says that ‘love’ is defined as…”), but I hope that you, dear reader, will kindly ignore that point. Anywho.\nsome definitions.\nCambridge Dictionary defines a photograph as a picture produced by a camera, and says that a camera is a device for taking photographs. Brilliant. The Collins dictionary shares this exact definition.\nMerriam-Webster defines a photograph as a picture or likeness obtained by photography, which is immediately unhelpful because now we have to chase through several more definitions. We’ll skip picture, and likeness is relatively similar in nature, so the main one is photography, which they cite as being “the art or process of producing images by the action of radiant energy and especially light on a sensitive surface (such as film or an optical sensor)”. This! This is the good stuff, getting to the heart of the matter!\nThe Oxford English Dictionary does the most precise job, in my opinion, referring to a photograph as “A picture or image obtained by photography; (originally) a picture made using a camera in which an image is focused on to sensitive material and then made visible and permanent by chemical treatment; (later also) a picture made by focusing an image and then storing it digitally.” As an aside, it was insane that I had to use my Georgia Tech email to access a definition, otherwise I’d have had to use a subscription. Shocking, OED.\nhistory.\nNow that we’ve nicely sorted our definitions into the spectrum of insane to sane, we can begin discerning what we think a photo is, with a bit of history! The first known instance of development in this space is with the camera obscura, which leverages the property of light wherein it travels in a straight line to project an inverted image onto a wall after passing through a small hole. People later used mirrors to re-invert the image back to the correct orientation for viewing; it’s important to note that this is not technically a photo yet, as there was no way to “save” the state of this light image, it was simply a projection onto a surface. Next there were early photographs, which used the chemical properties of some materials (such as silver salts), notably that they reacted with sunlight. Scientists began devising methods to imprint images using the prior camera obscura work combined with this “storage” mechanism, creating the first rudimentary cameras and photographs! After this came a long series of developments in not only storage medium, but lens design, etc., all of which were chiefly analog in nature, at least by our standards today. Photographic film was the penultimate addition to the lineage of photographic development, and spurred by the modern age, took a life of its own. While the principle is the same, film is much more flexible as a medium and has much better precision in some ways, compared to the methods of yore. The ultimate development (finally, good riddance), is that of the digital camera, which takes the sensor data that was received and encodes it into data that is written onto a storage drive of some sort. Specialized semiconductor image sensors needed to be developed in order to do this, the two main types being Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) and active-pixel (CMOS) sensors, which translate the electromagnetic waves and their attenuation (variability through media) into signals (currents which encode information in circuitry). All that to say I have no real idea how they work, so please don’t ask. This is the type of technology being used in not just larger digital cameras, but also phone cameras. A sort of honorable mention, technological development wise, is the advent of computational photography, which we’ll surely get back to later.\nusing our foundations.\nWith all our expository rambling out of the way, we can begin examining some of our definitions and examples of photography. I think my qualms with photography are more modern than not, so let’s agree to safely call daguerreotypes, calotypes, and other pre 1900s photographs just that, photographs. I also see no reason why film cameras don’t count, as they still work on the same principles, using light based imaging onto a reactive surface to encode visual information at a specific time. Thusly, we have wandered into the den of the beasts, digital cameras and computational photography. Here, I think we get into the pedantry and semantics more than anything. By all good definitions, the journey of a photograph ends with the digital camera. One could probably better define a digital camera’s action as capturing and storing an image (by translating the light waves to data through specially designed sensors), rather than “capturing a photograph”, because no photograph is taken. So yeah, that’s one faux-photo down, on to the next.\nIn contrast with digital cameras as a development, which still require precious sensing and direct translation to data that’s stored, computational photography introduces an intermediary processing pipeline into the mix, which takes sensor data and “improves” it according to algorithms and usually to some particular end. For example, Google’s Pixel phones have a mode called “Night Sight” which uses certain computational techniques to drastically improve picture visibility and quality in low-light photography settings (well, as much as one can call it photography, I guess). I regularly watch videos from the MKBHD channel, which does tech reviews and has, in the past, conducted blind smartphone camera tests, which are always quite telling. In referencing this interview, Samsung EVP Patrick Chomet says this in a very nice Verge article:\n\nThere was a very nice video by Marques Brownlee last year on the moon picture. Everyone was like, ‘Is it fake? Is it not fake?’ There was a debate around what constitutes a real picture. And actually, there is no such thing as a real picture. As soon as you have sensors to capture something, you reproduce [what you’re seeing], and it doesn’t mean anything. There is no real picture. You can try to define a real picture by saying, ‘I took that picture’, but if you used AI to optimize the zoom, the autofocus, the scene – is it real? Or is it all filters? There is no real picture, full stop.\n\nIn addition to techniques to auto-balance exposure, saturation, ISO, aperture, etc., we also have techniques that automatically stitch images from multiple cameras for more information, for example. In many ways, what the one, two, or even three cameras on the back of our phone see is never what we see on the screen in front of us. Just like daguerreotypes and calotypes, which were two different types of early image storing mechanisms (i.e. photographs) when cameras were first being invented, nowadays different smartphones have their own camera styles, pros and cons, and features, almost entirely dependent on the computational photography techniques and algorithms used. It’s this insane level of preprocessing that makes me annoyed; more often than not, different phones taking comically different pictures frustrates me. Inane exposure makes photos more aesthetic at times, as do sharper photos on average, but this tends to over accentuate features of pictures, making them somehow less accurate than before.\nAll photos aren’t real, let’s just revel in the memories and the smiles we capture. Maybe I should buy a nice SLR camera and revel in my cool, hip back to the future analog resurgence. That sounds rather fun, honestly.\n","description":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/are-photos-real/","path":"/blog/are-photos-real/","title":"Are photos even real?"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/attention/":{"body":"…is all you need, all you want, all you can eat, oh wait now there’s a discount, it’s cheap, and suddenly you’re transported into a world where you have it, a future image where you enjoy this thing, where its presence envelops you and comforts you and then the moment is lost and you’re back. back to where you were before, thumbs up and down on the screen, eyes glazed over, and you continue; those brief moments of respite are for the weak and decrepit, you don’t need a break, you need to\nFOCUS\nbut the neurons in your brain disagree, complex chemical calculations crumbling your resolve and careening your consciousness to the Next Big Thing That Happened Just Now; es en todos los redes sociales grandes, you feel? someone died, someone’s alive, stocks up, rates down, hand up, in a roman salute they say, all these moments blending together in a dizzying crescendo they say, but what is really cacophonous and cantankerous and criminal and horrifying and all i want to do is\nBREATHE\nbut it’s so hard, all these tendrils jutting out from screens, tearing my eyes away from my passions, my joys, my reasons to be alive, and honing in on the Next Big Thing – new show just dropped, seems like everything and everyone is recommending it, making me want to watch it, and then i’m forced to, locked into the ecosystem, the cycle, reminded of that one phineas and ferb episode where they’re locked up and re-educated, coerced into clearing their mind, no clamming up just clearing the mind and focusing on the Next Big Thing and then i blink and the video plays and i blink and the video keeps playing and i blink a little harder and my hand moves, largely of my own volition and the video stops.\nwell.\nthat’s nice.\na good sound.\nSILENCE.\n","description":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/attention/","path":"/blog/attention/","title":"Attention"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/doing-things-because-theyre-hard/":{"body":"Word Count: 1000\n\nIn another instance of joyous self-therapizing, and because I am too busy to properly nerd out about a paper review or a fun, bite-sized project or topic, today I will be talking about doing things because they are hard.\n(I think I started the last foray into my psyche in medias res, but sometimes it’s fun to switch it up; maybe one day I’ll write creatively, and you’ll see my propensity for it..)\nAnyway, it all started in 2019, when I really started playing video games.\n(Anyway is correct, anyone who says “anyways“ should be taken out back for a stern talking to; colloquialisms are for the weak and imperiled, which you will be if you say “anyways”.)\nTechnically, one could argue it really started when I began playing Phantom Forces on Roblox in middle school, but for sake of image, I’m going to ask you, dear reader, to ignore that particular fact. Here, we take a brief detour into a fun segment I call\nWhy do people play video games?\nFor some (including me, at times), it can feel like an escape from reality, a way to space out and enjoy mindless activity. You can rest other parts of your brain and relax, truly let go with the right game, whether that be clicking heads in the latest CoD, wandering an unfamiliar wilderness in Firewatch, or grinding through levels in Celeste. It gives you something to occupy the hands and the mind.\nAnother great reason to play games is to stay connected with friends who are far away; multiplayer games are released by the hundreds each year, and provide a space to spend time doing the above mindless (or, in some cases, intense) activities with a cadre of capable cadets (that was fun alliteration)!\nBut really, even though these reasons are true enough, I find myself enjoying games for one particular reason more than the rest; mechanical mastery. Sometimes this may translate into winning games, sometimes not, but the truth of it all is that getting a combo in, or mentally outplaying an opponent, or out-duelling someone, is the peak of fun. The natural addendum to this, then, is to prove to myself that by mastering the most mechanically challenging characters in a game, I’m sick as hell. In Overwatch, this meant learning Genji one-shot combos, ghost dashes, etc., blink pulse’s with Tracer, how to juggle properly with Winston, in addition to all the regular gamesense considerations that make the game even more fun. In THE FINALS, it meant learning how to master sword dash combos on the Light class. In Marvel Rivals, it means getting pummeled while I try to learn Spiderman and Black Panther. It’s brutal, but an exhilarating experience when it works!\nAside: I think I use the rule of three too much. Note to self: revisit writing style.\nAnd thus ends the fun segment\nFor whatever reason, learning hard things has been enjoyable in some ways. Another good example from my personal life has been learning Vim, which I started because I thought it would be tough and cool, and now has turned into a sort of immutable mainstay in my life, mostly because now my muscle memory tends towards my Vim binds and it is highly embarrassing when I “hjkl” in textboxes. I have additionally read “Your problem with Vim is that you don’t grok vi” several times, which if you haven’t, you seriously should. It’s a fantastic read about the depth and breadth of stuff that stock Vim supports, and it inspired me to try stock Vim for a while.\nBut like, why? Do you have problems?\nYes. Probably. Next question.\nCare to elaborate?\nNo. If you insist! There’s a sense of pride and accomplishment that comes with doing the hard thing; with going the distance to reach a height most people don’t get to. To separate yourself. A part of it likely stems from one’s self worth; I, for one, recognize that I measure my self worth frequently relative to those I deem similar to myself in demographic and intellectual capabilities. This is also where it goes wrong. Obviously. I once tried reading “War and Peace” just to say I’d read it – to be clear, probably a great book, but so incredibly dense and just not for me. It was something I’d deemed “hard”, something that I thought would make me seem cultured and cool, saying I’d read Tolstoy’s work. Phooey.\n(Is that how you spell that? I’m not sure how much I care about its phoneticization.)\n“Comparison is the thief of joy” is something that gets thrown around a lot. I’d argue that based on personal experience, it’s largely true, but not without its nuance. I find myself particularly motivated at times when I see others succeeding, as I’d imagine many others are. Toeing that line is probably the most challenging thing I do on a regular basis, because it forms the foundation for the rest of my day. But really, in its most pure form, I think I have just approached it wrong.\nIf we strive to do things because they are hard, don’t do it for the destination, do it for the journey. The struggle of learning, the grit and sweat spent in the process, is what makes it worth your while. If you do the hard thing to say you did it, what did you gain except another item on a list, at least in your mind? The recontextualization is tough, but I think it is a valuable journey in and of itself. Hopefully.\nWhere do we go from here?\nWhen I was doing things because they were hard for the achievement, I felt as though I’d lost the part of myself that enjoyed learning. It was performative. Assuming this ends up on my website, clearly that hasn’t changed too much, but I’m finally more cognizant of my approaches to self motivation, and I hope to continue learning new things not for others, but for myself. Take care, dear reader, and I’ll see you on Marvel Rivals playing Spiderman.\n","description":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/doing-things-because-theyre-hard/","path":"/blog/doing-things-because-theyre-hard/","title":"Doing things because they are hard"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/other-blogs/":{"body":"I guess I can’t call this a brief detour from our regularly scheduled programming, since I have yet to establish what regularly scheduled programming looks like, but I wanted to have a blogpost that I update on occasion to store some of my favorite other blogs, and people who I know!

This is useful in scheduling, partitioning, financial portfolio optimization, and more! While the problem itself is NP-Complete, there exist a host of approximation algorithms that allow us to do “pretty good” in practice. To see a careful treatment of deterministic MaxCut algorithms, check out these two lecture notes.\nSome quick nomenclature: an α-approximation for a (maximization/minimization) problem is when we:\n\n(max) Do as good as 1/α * OPT\n(min) Do as good as α * OPT\n\nFor our purposes, lets say we don’t even care about doing good right now, just that we care about doing good in expectation. That is, while there exists a 1/2-approximation for MaxCut, we want to create an algorithm such that the expected size of our output cut satisfies the 1/2 approximation ratio.\nOur simple algorithm\nFor every vertex v ∈ V = (A, B), choose with 50% probability whether it is in A or B. That’s it, that creates the cut.\nGood job! Take a well-deserved break now.\n\nProving it informally\nNow that you’re back from break, let’s get to proving this with words!\nFor any edge e = (u, v) ∈ E, we have Pr[(u, v) ∈ C] = 1/2. For each edge e, create a random variable Xₑ such that Xₑ = 1 if e ∈ C else 0. Notice now that the size of the cut, |C| = ∑ Xₑ.\nThe overall proof is then E[|C|] = ∑ E[Xₑ] = ∑ Pr[e ∈ C] = |E|/2 ≥ |C*|/2, for some optimal cut C*. Just throw linearity of expectation and use our previous facts - this, plus the fact that the size of the largest possible cut is bounded by the number of edges (that is, |E| ≥ |C*|), and we get the result we want. |E| = |C*| only when the graph G is bipartite; this follows basically by definition.\nProving it with Lean\nHaving encountered this simple and elegant algorithm + proof in my algorithms course, I wanted to see if I could formalize it in Lean. I’ve been getting more interested in formal verification, so this seemed like a fun challenge, especially w.r.t the randomization aspect of it! For the uninitiated, Lean is a programming language and proof assistant similar to Rocq. There has been a big movement in recent times to formalize mathematics and CS concepts within the Lean MathLib and CSLib, and I’m eager to see where it goes :)\nStructures\nThe first step is always representing our key structures. Lean already has a SimpleGraph, so all we need to do is design a structure to store our Cut:\n\nWe also create some helper functions, namely for:\n\nCreating cuts from an assignment, a mapping from vertices to booleans (true in A, false in B)\nsize of the cut\nWhether a given edge is in the cut at all.\n\n\nSome notable things:\nThe backbone of our Cut is the Finset, which is a type representing a finite set of elements of some type α. Since graphs are finite structures, we get a lot of free convenient properties from leveraging Finset here. We also use typeclass declarations for Fintype and DecidableEq. Fintype α lets our function know that α is finite, and DecidableEq knows that propositional equality is decidable for all elements of type α.\nGenerally, we also use the idea of an assignment function quite a bit, i.e. some mapping from V -&gt; Bool that defines our cut.\n\nFrom here on out, I’ll skimp on some of the proof details and go over more of the overarching approaches for some of my lemmas, since that seems like a more economical use of time and article space.\nFirst, we finalize our randomized cut instances and the edge containment indicator function, which basically represents our random variable Χₑ from the proof.\n\nProofs\nFinally, in the order I proved them, here are the lemmas and theorems!\n\ncut_size_eq_sum_indicators: |C| = ∑ χₑ ∀ e ∈ E\n\n\nHere, we first unfold our relevant definitions. Then, we convert to using summation for both sides, and finally we simplify and show that our sets are equal; if the sets are equal, their cardinalities must be equal as well!\n\ncount_diff_assignments: half of the 2^N possible assignments have f u ≠ f v\n\n\nThis proof is a behemoth of sorts, unexpectedly. The key thread here is to codify the fact that f u ≠ f v is half the space by creating a bijection and showing it is an involution (its own inverse). Then, if we know that the sets f u ≠ f v and f u = f v have the same cardinality, and that they equal 2^|V|, we get our result.\n\nprob_edge_in_cut: Pr[e ∈ C] = 1/2\n\n\nFor this proof we use induction on the edges to extract the vertices, then claim that the sum of the indicators when u ≠ v is equal to the cardinality of the Finset when f u ≠ f v (the count of “good” assignments, when not in same vertex set of partition). This, plus our result from the count_diff_assignments (counting lemma) plus some tiny polishing steps gives us our result.\n\nexpected_cut_size: E[|C|] = |E|/2 (the important one!)\n\n\nThis proof begins with our original expectation statement and chains together our previous proofs to give us our major result. First, we leverage cut_size_eq_sum_indicators to get our size in terms of the indicators. Next, we simulate our linearity of expectation via Finset.sum_comm and Finset.sum_div to move things around. Finally, we use the calc tactic to sequentially show equivalences with the prob_edge_in_cut lemma and summation results to give us our answer!\n\nA brief interlude: finding the Max Cut\nIn order to wrap this up and prove things with respect to the actual maximum cut, we need to find a way to represent this. Today I learned about the Finset.univ.sup, meaning “supremum”. A supremum is the smallest quantity greater than or equal to each element of a given (sub)set. In effect, we iterate over all Finsets, create Cuts based off of each possible assignment, and pick the best/max one!\n\nBack to the proofs.\n\n\nmaxCut_le_edges: Maximum cut is at most |E|. This proof is short enough to include in its entirety:\n\n\n\nrand_approx_guarantee: E[|C|] &gt;= |maxCut|/2. This proof is also short, because it stands tall on the backs of giants (the others).\n\n\nWe basically just use the expected_cut_size and then simplify the division by two on either side, then use our inequality. Note that the expression (∑ assignment : V -&gt; Bool, ((randomizedMaxCut (G := G) assignment).size : ℝ)) / (Fintype.card (V -&gt; Bool)) accurately represents E[|C|], because it is the cut size divided by the total number of possible assignments.\nLearnings\nLean is hard. Also, I have to learn to better speak the language; it was pretty challenging to learn how some tactics worked even with the reference (quite mathematically heavy, as is to be expected) and AI tools (more hand-wavy, imprecise at times), but this was a great learning experience and I’m happy I took the time to prove this! My original goal was to try proving something similar about randomized Quicksort, but that felt like too hard a challenge for a Lean novice.\nThe rest of my code (i.e. the full proofs and my silly comments) can be found at this Github repo: verif-randomized-maxcut.\nThank you for reading!\n","description":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/randomized-maxcut/","path":"/blog/randomized-maxcut/","title":"Proving bounds for the Randomized MaxCut Approximation algorithm in Lean4"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/relationship-with-memory/":{"body":"Word Count: 2607\nSection 1: Impermanence\nA couple days ago, I was in Dallas with my family, visiting family friends for a series of birthdays and Christmas celebrations. At the end of this day, my cousin’s grandmother wanted to play the Saraswati veena for us all, a stringed instrument typically used in Carnatic Indian classical music. She started playing when she was nine years old, and when she played for us three days ago, she was 77. For thirty minutes, I was reminded of my 6th grade trip to South India, eating with my hands off a banana leaf plate with my classmates, revelling in the humid heat of Kerala. Her eyes were closed, but her worn hands were true and for that half hour, I was mesmerised. And yet, three days later, I remember her face, her eyes, her hands, her posture, but precious little of the music itself. It’s interesting; the one thing that I cared about the most in that moment was what I remembered the least.\nOver the summer, I went to Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra in New York to watch Wynton Marsalis and his band play with traditional Indian instrumentalists from both Hindustani and Carnatic backgrounds, in a performance called “The Rhythms of India”. What I remember was that it was fantastic, and I felt moved. Clearly, live music tends to have that effect on me. There was one particular drum solo that I recall being ingrained in my memory for a month after the performance, but as it stands, it’s disappeared, replaced by what feels like a cheap imitation conjured by the mind, even if the memory of the emotions I felt at the performance remain intact. As an aside, if you can, try your best to watch Wynton Marsalis; he’s a fantastic performer and cultivator of the jazz arts, and his “Big Band Holidays” albums are fantastic.\nIn the seventh grade, I was on a bit of a tear with reading; I had gotten through most of Agatha Christie’s works, and was moving on to sci-fi. My young mind got through a couple books of Frank Herbert’s “Dune”, “Brave New World”, and some of Asimov’s seminal works, like “Foundation” and “I, Robot”. Last week, I went to Barnes and Noble with my friend and stumbled upon “Foundation” again, and picked it up. Now, given my fantastic use of the rule of three here, I’m sure you can see where I’m going with this. But what good is it to say I’ve read “Foundation” if I can’t recall it? Is there any pride, any sense of accomplishment, to be had with saying, “I’ve read all of Poirot!”, if one has a scant recollection regardless? Or is it the emotions we carry on after the fact, the sensations that linger in the mind and perhaps the body, that are of value or import?\nAs a further extension of that idea, and a brief detour from the overall point, I feel as though this discussion lends itself nicely to tackling the idea of impermanence. Take jazz, for example; I can go to a jazz bar and listen to a wholly unique rendition of a standard, by virtue of improvisation and a skilled band. I can play with my friends, and feel alive as we enable and push each other to grow as musicians. But in the same vein, I can listen to the great Miles Davis’ solo on So What again and again, replaying what was, to him, a single moment in 1959. Does this permanence dull its impact on us? Does experiencing something live, but having to deal with the fallibility of memory change its effect on us? To be sure, I prefer live music, and I’d be remiss in saying it doesn’t have its own special way of brightening my day, but I can just as easily get a vinyl of an album I love, and have the sound pour through good speakers, close my eyes, and teleport myself. Glenn Stallcop says on his blog:\n\n“Ideas are only pure in their abstract form.  In reality, they are fleeting and fragile events.  Plato thought that Concepts were the only true reality, and life was just an imperfect reflection or shadow.  But actually, it is the reverse which is true.  Reality is messy and in constant flux.  It is Concepts which are the simple approximations of fleeting moments.”\n\nIt’s a sobering thought, that everything is technically destined for decay. Some day, there will come a time when Miles Davis’ So What recording from 1959 is played for the last time. Some day, the last page of Tintin will be turned. Some day, someone will watch Grey’s Anatomy for the last time (thank god). My evidently muddled thoughts on (im)permanence have informed a fair few aspects of how I approach the world, and these thoughts are intimately tied to how I approach memory, or the art of remembering things with intentionality.\nSection 2: Memory, Loving, and Knowing\nMy memory is interesting. I tend to remember vivid flashes of memory from various points in my life – I can, for example, recall when I dropped a die-cast model Discovery Space Shuttle on my foot when I was four years old, at our old house a couple miles from where I’m writing this. I can remember my first (and I believe only) goal in my high school soccer career, running into the box and sliding into the ball, watching it sail past the keeper into the mid left of the net. Being shocked, happy, pumping my fist. I can remember deciding whether or not to take a nap during my APUSH exam (I ended up napping for 10 minutes and then taking the exam anyway). But on the flipside, my short term memory sucks. I forget what I did a couple hours ago, yesterday, last week. It takes an insane amount of effort to remember if I took a shower, or I ate, or I did a task. I have a calendar which I rely on for almost everything, and I mean everything. It has the usual – classes, birthdays (we will come back to this later), tasks, but it also has things like “Call Parents”, “eat”, “go to bed, dumbass”, “check in with friends”, etc. This calendar acts as a storage for some of my mental load, for better or worse. Whether a function of my brain or other factors, I seem to thrive off of regularity, and my calendar is a vehicle for that. I guess in some ways, regularity can make each day seem less meaningful? If the same thing happens each day, the days may blend together. Alternatively, having regularity can make the bright interjections even brighter; going for lunch with my friends, having a nice dinner with my family, visiting Dallas to see my cousins.\nA related thought I had, which has come up with my family and partner before, is the idea of memory specifically as it relates to spontaneity. To me, spontaneity is formulaic. You begin by remembering someone or something, and from there you can plan out how to act on it. Some studies do show that spontaneity can be triggered by the reactivation of stored memories, so at least in some sense, my approach isn’t unfounded, but this sort of naturally begs the question: if I offset the mental load of tasks to a calendar, does that make them less meaningful to others? This is something I continue to struggle with, and not something I have the answer to, although it helps to verbalize it here.\n“To be loved is to be known” is a quote that resonates quite a bit with me. I don’t really know why, but there’s something warm and sweet in being able to coexist around others, knowing they understand you fundamentally, and it’s changed how I love and show love, in some ways. Interestingly enough, the way I first realized this about myself was through my love of NBC sitcoms. At the time of writing, I’ve watched The Office around 3 or 4 times all the way through, and the first 4 seasons even more. I’ve watched Parks and Recreation at least twice, and I could, at one point, give you the season and episode number of any episode of the first three seasons of Community if you gave me a plot point or two. These shows have shaped who I am in some way, and taught me pop culture, made me appreciate certain styles of humor, and made me glean more about myself in many ways. I will always love them. As it does, however, time passes, and I find it harder to remember the shows’ intimate details, even though I retain the emotions of watching them, and the vibes and enjoyment I had. As an aside, a point of pride for me is feeling as though I know the characters, even if I forget the content. I am almost always able to get into the frame of mind of characters I care about. These shows have clearly impacted me permanently (I make far too many references to count, these days), but it scares me.\nShould love be constant and uniform, then? What do we say about the friend we talk to every day, compared to the friend we reach out to once a year and pick up immediately where we left off? Another thing with shows, and media more generally, is the preservation of the image in my mind. As I mentioned earlier, sometimes all I remember of a piece of media is the emotion it brought to me, some memories of the feelings naturally stronger than others (whether by virtue of recency or otherwise). There occasionally exists this tension between my desire to re-up my memory of the content, and my fear of tarnishing the memory of the feeling. Take Avatar: The Last Airbender, for example. I first watched Avatar my sophomore year of high school, and I loved it. Truly; the plot and characters were moving, and I still follow along with the Darkhorse comics and other content that’s released (original movie notwithstanding). That was 5 years ago, though. I’ve grown and hopefully matured as a person, my perspectives have changed, and my humor has changed as well. Watching Avatar now could very well taint my enjoyment of it, past, present, and future. This idea has stopped me from (re)watching a handful of shows that I know I loved, but couldn’t bear the thought of losing the feelings for. Something to work on, or maybe let be.\nContinuing with the maxim of loving as knowing, we turn back to interpersonal relationships (oh joy)! This is something I have a curious relationship with (heh), and it stems from an unintentionally strict application of our aforementioned maxim. Similar to characters, I love people by knowing them. Their hobbies, their strengths, their character (for lack of a better word), but also the facts. Their birthdays, their addresses, their families, their accomplishments. I take some pride in being able to wish someone a Happy Birthday early in the day, because I knew it was their birthday! In a very “treat others as you’d like to be treated” way, I imagine that others appreciate being remembered and known just as I would, which is a slight misconception. Sometimes, birthdays feel sad for this reason; it feels as though the people that matter most seem to forget, but I try my best to remind myself that even though I treat this as a maxim, it’s local to me. I don’t really think “love language” categorizations are fair or really accurate, but it’s certainly the case that the act of love is unique to each individual. In any case, I’ve thought about how I love and how it ties in to remembering for quite a bit, and once again it’s nice to put an idea to paper (GDocs).\nSection 3: Permanence\nPictures and I go way back. I used to want to be a photographer, actually; I got pretty good at Photoshop and Lightroom (as well as a middle schooler could be, at least), and took lots of photographs of landscapes, animals, et cetera. Crucially, I feel the need to point out here that I pirated both, and I vehemently despise Adobe for their subscription model and insane AI practices over the last few years. End minirant. The other side of photography was actually being photographed. For whatever reason, being photographed and thereby being perceived is, or at least was, kind of terrifying to me. A possible reason for this is that by immortalizing a part of me that I didn’t want you to know or see, I feel worse. I do distinctly remember feeling worse about my figure and face growing up; I didn’t like how skinny I was and I didn’t like my smile. This seems to have translated in some way to an aversion to being photographed. It’s gotten a bit better recently, as has my smile (at least I seem to think so, which is what really matters), but the foundations of the fear were quite curious in my opinion. Of course, the other perspective that arises with photographs ties back to our discussion of permanence. There will inevitably be a time when your loved ones leave you – it could even be you first. What do you do when they’re gone? Will you remember them faithfully, and how can you guarantee that? More pointedly, will the memory of the feelings they incited and the emotions surrounding your cumulative interactions be valuable enough to offset the inevitable decay of memory? I don’t remember my Dadu’s voice or face, because I wasn’t really conscious then. We have precious few pictures of him, and he exists primarily in the consciousness of my father and my Dadi. It’s sobering. For all the reasons above, having pictures, videos, and other means of permanence make for a safe back-up of one’s memory.\nIn the vein of permanence, another thing to think about is sentimentality and one’s legacy; the ways in which we’re remembered, either in the minds of others, through actions making their mark, or objects of significance. For example, I recently had a conversation with my father about watches. He wears an Apple watch most days, but has a few assorted watches that are particularly important to him, including a few gifts from my Nanu, which he cherishes. Through this watch, the memory of my Nanu is shared long after he’s gone (although we hope that isn’t soon), and in it is a special reminder of the relationship between my Nanu and my father as well. As for legacy, that’s a little more involved. What goal do I want when it comes to my legacy? Do I want to be remembered as a good worker, a visionary, a great family man? How consciously should I think about the image of me in others’ minds, and how to form and shape that image? I suppose realistically, only time will tell, and hopefully I can remember to check in on this treatise of sorts and reflect on it.\nThe end and beginning\nAll this started because I asked the question, “If I say I like(d) something, but I don’t remember the content, did I ever really”? I still don’t really know. I think maturing will be realizing eventually that although the decay and fallibility of the mind is inevitable, we can respect that, enjoy the emotions as they pass and linger, and move on. I’m not sure if that’s currently satisfying to me, but it’s what I’ve landed on and I’ve also been typing for about 4 hours, give or take, so there.\nI hope you enjoyed,\n\n– Arjun\n","description":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/relationship-with-memory/","path":"/blog/relationship-with-memory/","title":"My relationship with memory"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/rewriting-zip/":{"body":"Betwixt all of the Marvel Rivals and drumming I’ve been doing since I finished my fall semester, I thought it’d be a good idea to try rewriting std::iter::zip; in the past, I’ve followed along with Jon Gjengset’s Crust of Rust on Iterators (to make Flatten) and tried my hand at FlatMap as well (see Elton Pinto’s blog as a nice insight). This article is inspired by his, although will probably less involved as I found zip to be easier to implement, largely because FlatMap, for example, involves nested iterators and FnMut and other such fancy traits, while Zip is a more intuitive operation. There were only a few hiccups along the way.\n\n\n\nAs an aside, did you know that hiccough is a valid spelling, and hiccup is the more modernized version? English is dumb.\nWhat the hell is a zip?\nRust’s std::iter::zip has one simple goal; when calling zip on two items that can be turned into iterators, we want zip to return pairs of each subsequent entry in each input! That’s a mouthful, but a simple example from the docs will likely help:\n\nNow that you hopefully understand what’s happening a bit better, the next step is\nFiguring out how to make this shit\nMost things in the standard library are designed as follows:\n\nHave a function to do a thing (zip), and create a struct that represents the thing you want the result to be Zip.\nUse traits, associated types, and generics to implement functionality on top of said resulting thing impl Iterator for ...\nProfit\n\nSo, let’s get started with all of this, beginning with our zip function:\n\nWe haven’t quite implemented the Zip struct yet, but we will soon. For now, notice that intuitively we need both a and b to be able to be converted to Iterators; thus, we can place the IntoIterator trait bound on them. Having the bound be Iterator would be “too strict”, in a sense, and would functionally require us to call .into_iter() on everything we’d pass in to zip.\nAlso, while IntoIterator is a trait, IntoIter is an associated type! Associated types are type aliases associated with another type/trait. You may be thinking, this sounds a lot like generics, and yeah they’re kind of similar, but the crucial difference is that associated types are specific to an implementation (i.e. in the impl block) of a trait, while generics allow multiple implementations. This thread has a good explanation, which I’ll attempt to summarize.\n\nThis is the definition of the IntoIterator trait, with the subsequent definition of the IntoIter type as well. Notice here that the type IntoIter resolves to a concrete type, as IntoIterator is implemented on a specific type. For example, if we call into_iter() on an object of type Vec&lt;u32&gt;, then the Item is of type u32, and thus we create an Iterator&lt;Item = u32&gt;, which is exactly as desired.\nClearly, for each implementation of a given trait for a given type, we have a unique resolution for the associated type, which makes intuitive sense. On the flipside, something like Add&lt;Rhs&gt; can be implemented multiple times for a variety of types of Rhs, i.e. parametric polymorphism (generics).\nNow that that’s out of the way, let’s get back to\nZipping it! Time for structs\nOur zip function wants an output of type Zip&lt;A::IntoIter, B::IntoIter&gt;, so let’s do that.\n\nWell. That was easy.\nThe only thing we’re missing is the new function that we used in zip, but that shouldn’t be too hard:\n\nNotice how the return type matches our zip function signature; the rest is pretty reasonable.\nImplementing Iterators Interestingly (not)\nThe last thing we need to do is to make our Zip struct actually somewhat useful, so we need to implement the Iterator trait for it, which will get us all sorts of goodies for free (please do consult the standard library if you forget). The only thing we really need to implement for iterators is next (it’s the “required method” they mention in the docs); here’s the code:\n\nHere, we notice that Item is an associated type for Iterator; crucially, it’s not predefined, and so we can set it to whatever we need. Here, since our goal is to get tuples of items from our two iterators, we simply do as described. The function implementation itself is also largely trivial – just get the next values of both iterators, and return a tuple of them. If either is None, the ? operator will gracefully handle this and return None for the overall iterator as desired.\nWe’re done??\nYes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHave a happy holidays and see you next time!\n","description":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/rewriting-zip/","path":"/blog/rewriting-zip/","title":"Rewriting Rust's zip (poorly)"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/talking/":{"body":"Art is a conversation.\nIt is weird to say without some faux-profundity that I think the goal of art is twofold; for an artist to express their emotions, ideas, reactions to something, and to create an opportunity for dialogue. It seems to me that the most successful artists, or at least the ones we know or perceive the strongest/most/best, tend to be successful at creating opportunities to discuss art. At the end of Sarah Thornton’s Seven Days in the Art World, she says, “After looking at art, you ask yourself: Is this intriguing? Deeply amusing? Do I want to spend time with it? Does it become more compelling the more I think about it?”\nIn mulling those words over, I don’t think I’ve felt very strongly about art before, and that is an interesting thing to verbalize because it feels so antithetical to how fascinating I believe it is. I went to the MoMA with my girlfriend recently, and I finally got to see van Gogh’s Starry Nights, as well as Monet’s Water Lilies. They were beautiful, and as an untrained non-artist myself, I can only imagine the sheer depth of technique that made their paintings amazing, both pedagogically and emotionally. And yet, while I enjoyed the aesthetics of these works, I don’t think I managed to feel strongly enough about them.\nPerhaps I am not conversing with art, not asking the right questions, approaching the canvas as an investigative reporter would, and not as a traveler on the subway asking about your day. Part of me wants to examine an artist’s technique, understand the how, the color theory, the pressure, the composition, the scale. The other, seemingly smaller part of me maybe wants to ask what I’d do if I was there, or ask why I liked it. Perhaps if I was alone in the room, I could think about the water lilies again, think about the sounds there – water lapping at the lilies’ lips, a light breeze rippling across the pearly water and foiling around my ears, the soft ‘plip’ of a fish or frog breaking the surface – and the touch, and the taste of the air, and the water moving and the sun shining, reflecting, refracting, gently through the surface.\nThat sounds nice.\nI could have been there, then. The silence of an empty room with a swathe of canvas would have given way to a new world, or rather a lens into an old one. Perhaps I will go again.\n–\nWhen I talk with slightly more modern art, I think the conversation is harder for me, and perhaps for everyone, as it presumes context, which is a fickle thing. Each piece reflects its creator, and as such we first turn to them. As I write this I think about a shirt I have with an abstract, geometric, apparently constructivist piece called Composition of Circles and Overlapping Angles by Sophie Taeuber-Arp, a Swiss Dadaist.\n\n\nSophie Taeuber-Arp, Composition of Circles and Overlapping Angles, 1930.\nThe Museum of Modern Art, New York. The Riklis Collection of McCrory Corporation/The Museum of Modern Art, Department of Imaging and Visual Resources/©2019 Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York/VG Bild-Kunst, Bonn\n\n“I enjoy the contrast between the muted blue-grey background and the rest of the colors; in particular, the juxtaposition of the white with the deep orange-red (#FF2F08) and prussian blue (#023E99).”\n“I’m drawn to the sandpaper-like texture in the top left, especially how it juts out in the intersections of various other colors”\n“The three dots on the left, and three dots on the bottom, have interesting notions of symmetry”\n“Why did you paint this? What did it make you feel when painting, and what did you feel while painting it?”\n“What sort of techniques did you use to get even geometric shapes, and the sandpaper-esque texture of the brown-gold sections?”\n“What do you think is the purpose of art? Is it to enjoy for beauty’s sake, is there any value in that? Should all art be beholden to some orthogonal perspective behind a veil, especially one that acts more as a steep step for many?”\n“What is Dadaism? Did you know you were one of the pioneers of the movement, and foundational in the field of concrete art and geometric abstraction?”\n“What made you choose the title you chose for this piece?”\n“Why?”\n–\nThe “intrinsic decorative urge should not be eradicated,” she wrote, “It is one of humankind’s deep-rooted, primordial urges.”1\n–\nThank you, Ms. Tauber-Arp; I’m glad to have spoken to you. I carry you with me when I walk around, pretending to be sophisticated, trying my hardest to prove my love for things I don’t understand.\nPerhaps I will go again, and then I’ll get it. After all, it did look cool.\n\n1\nARTNews on Sophie Taeuber-Arp\n\n","description":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/talking/","path":"/blog/talking/","title":"talking"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/tuesday/":{"body":"Today was interesting, an unassuming sort of day which walks past you on the trail, chirping up with a short “Hi” and a modest wave of the digits, ambling about at an average pace, not a care. He has places to be, to be sure, a being of righteous purpose and poise most days, but on this day his work is largely done, and he moves with the calm of the mid-afternoon lull that befits a job reasonably well done. This day carries notes of petrichor, of just enough of God’s own blood blessing us, as it is wont to do. The week has barely begun, and yet instead of a brusque and baleful bout of problems that tends to sink the ship, the bow of this week bursts brightly… with a light breeze and the sun peeking out gently from the clouds. This day wears well-worn jeans, of a slightly darker hue, but still well within the norm, and a nice clean black short-sleeves polo, wrinkles smarting the sides, perhaps a stain near the lower back. All in all, this is a fine day, certainly not Monday, or, God forbid, that horrid timeless moment at the end of Sunday where you realize you have work to contend with. No, today, like many before and many after, is a good, plain day. It keeps you company on the park bench, lets you take a brief moment of respite from the incessant houndings of the world, and then prods you awake when it’s time to return, waving its hand twice as goodbye as it saunters away, shoes thump thump thumping softly against the trail.\n","description":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/tuesday/","path":"/blog/tuesday/","title":"tuesday"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/untitled-1/":{"body":"Word Count: 194\n\nIt’s there, barely, but it’s there. A maple seed, drifting through the air, floating aimlessly as it swirls by my eyes. In that moment, I see what it could become; a tree with strong roots, quintessentially unique leaves, a beautiful rouge come fall. Brilliant, bountiful branches, each with their own special stories to tell, holding their own weight, an ecosystem of thought supported. And it floats by.\nThere are more seeds. They, too, float by, going beside me, soaring above me, streaking past me. Some land in my hair as I look up, and a bright light shines. As I look down to focus, pencil scratching on paper (or keys clacking on keyboard), a lossy transfer occurs. And then the seed falls off my head, and I stop.\nI feel rooted, sometimes, arms out wide. I continually write my own story as I grow, and my arms support the weight of my dreams, but I only have two. Ten fingers, more granularity, a greater surface area. And the seeds float by.\nOne day, I will take a step, creak my branches definitively across my body, and catch a seed. Maybe today is that day.\n","description":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/untitled-1/","path":"/blog/untitled-1/","title":"Untitled 1"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/why-blog/":{"body":"Word Count: 279\nAs my first actual blog post, I feel like it’s fitting to discuss why I want to write a blog at all, as well as some expectations for content going forward (if I ever get around to it, that is). I think what initially inspired me was joining GT’s programming languages and compilers club, dependently-typed. The first few talks I attended were fascinating, and the club chairs pointed me to lobste.rs as a great resource for tech blogs. Through that, I’ve spent much more time reading and learning about some of my favorite technical topics! I’ve since had the motivation to begin organizing my learning about some of these topics, particularly ones that I believe I’m either not well versed in, or those that I would like to master.\nThe core idea here is that starting off, my blog is for me. It will be a place for me to document my journey through programming language theory, language design and implementation, and quantum computing. As I begin to get more and more confident, it may yet become a place for me to broaden my horizons or, perhaps, try my hand at teaching/explaining things. Time and time again, I’ve found myself collating several sources into a patchwork of knowledge in my mind, and this amalgamation of unique perspectives makes my understanding deeper; it would be awesome to one day see some of my work help another in a similar vein.\nThat’s basically it for this blog (article?) I think. For future posts, I have no real expectation of min/max length, and I may also intersperse the technical talk with some more personal drabbles as well.\nI hope you enjoyed,\n\nArjun\n\n","description":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/why-blog/","path":"/blog/why-blog/","title":"Why do we blog?"}},"docInfo":{"http://127.0.0.1:1111/":{"body":328,"description":0,"path":0,"title":0},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/":{"body":2,"description":0,"path":1,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/aoc24day3/":{"body":685,"description":0,"path":2,"title":5},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/aoc24day5/":{"body":407,"description":0,"path":2,"title":6},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/are-photos-real/":{"body":787,"description":0,"path":3,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/attention/":{"body":168,"description":0,"path":2,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/doing-things-because-theyre-hard/":{"body":538,"description":0,"path":5,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/other-blogs/":{"body":43,"description":0,"path":2,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/randomized-maxcut/":{"body":690,"description":0,"path":3,"title":7},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/relationship-with-memory/":{"body":1319,"description":0,"path":3,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/rewriting-zip/":{"body":405,"description":0,"path":3,"title":4},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/talking/":{"body":406,"description":0,"path":2,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/tuesday/":{"body":148,"description":0,"path":2,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/untitled-1/":{"body":110,"description":0,"path":3,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/why-blog/":{"body":147,"description":0,"path":2,"title":1}},"length":15},"lang":"English"}
